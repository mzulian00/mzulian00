- Robot Learning MSc projects, collection of four homeworks committed during the course regarding:
    - [Ekf and ROS](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise1-EKF-and-ROS): implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter applied to a single and double
     pendulum on ROS.
    - [Rl-fundamentals](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise2-rl-fundamentals): use of Gym Environment used to control the cartpole 
   agent exploiting different reward functions.

- [Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Modeling-and-Control) MSc project, split in a first part of sensors system modeling resilient to
  adversarial attacks and a second part about the control of a set of magnetic levitators described by a certain dynamics exploiting a regulator and an observer from both
  centralized and distributed views;
- [Network Dynamics](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Networks-Dynamics), a series of three homeworks completed during the
  course and focused on modeling agent systems dynamics applying Graph Teory with the help of NetworkX Python library;
