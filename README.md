## Hi! I'm Matteo, welcolme to my GitHub ðŸ˜Š 

* M.S. in Automation and Intelligent CyberPhysical Systems at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) with grade **cum laude**. Here's the [study plan]().
* B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it/) with grade **110/110**. Here's the [study plan]().
* I can speak fluently Italian and English, currently learning German and Spanish.

Here is a brief summary of what you can find in my repositories:
- Machine Learning MSc project [Implementazione di una rete GAN applicata ad un task di Image Inpainting](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Machine-Learning), ADD DESCRIPTION
- Reinforcement Learning MSc project [Analysis of Sim-to-Real strategies with Domain Randomization techniques](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/tree/main/project), ADD DESCRIPTION

- Robot Learning MSc projects, collection of four homeworks committed during the course regarding:
    - [Ekf and ROS](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise1-EKF-and-ROS): implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter applied to a single and double
     pendulum on ROS.
    - [Rl-fundamentals](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise2-rl-fundamentals): use of Gym Environment used to control the cartpole 
   agent exploiting different reward functions.
    - [Q-learning](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise3-qlearning): training cartpole with Q-Learning Temporal Difference algorithm.
    - [Policy-gradient](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Robot-Learning/exercise4-policygradient): use of Policy Gradient algorithms like PPO and SAC from
    stable-baselines3 library.
- [Nonlinear Control and Aereospace Applications](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Nonlinear-Control): MATLAB/Simulink implementation of various nonlinear control techniques including Feedback Linearization (FL), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC)
- [Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Modeling-and-Control) MSc project, split in a first part of sensors system modeling resilient to
  adversarial attacks and a second part about the control of a set of magnetic levitators described by a certain dynamics exploiting a regulator and an observer from both
  centralized and distributed views;
- [Network Dynamics](https://github.com/mzulian00/homeworks-Networks-Dynamics), a series of three homeworks completed during the
  course and focused on modeling agent systems dynamics applying Graph Teory with the help of NetworkX Python library;
- System and Device Programming MSc project [Spiking Neural Networks](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Spiking-Neural-Networks), ADD DESCRP
