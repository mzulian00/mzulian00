   agent exploiting different reward functions.
    - [Q-learning](https://github.com/mzulian00/homework-Robot-Learning/exercise3-qlearning) : training cartpole with Q-Learning Temporal-Difference algorithm.
    - [Policy-gradient](https://github.com/mzulian00/homework-Robot-Learning/exercise4-policygradient) : use of Policy Gradient algorithms like PPO and SAC from
    Stable-Baselines3 library.

- [Spiking Neural Networks](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Spiking-Neural-Networks) - group project :  ![rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Rust-black)  
Implemented Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) in Rust to simulate neural dynamics. Controlled errors were introduced into spike activity to evaluate robustness and fault tolerance.

![simulink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Simulink-white)  
Implementation of various nonlinear control techniques applied to aerospace scenarios, including Feedback Linearization (FL), Sliding Mode Control (SMC) and Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC).  

- [Modeling and Control of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Modeling-and-Control) - group projects :     ![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-MATLAB-orange)
  ![simulink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Simulink-white)
  - Sensor system modeling resilient to adversarial attacks using Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA).
  - Control of a set of magnetic levitator dynamics exploiting a regulator and an observer, with a comparison of centralized and distributed approaches.

![simulink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Simulink-white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)
  - [Image processing](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-1-image-processing) :  implemented a machine learning algorithm to detect driver drowsiness and focus. Eye openness and gaze direction were analyzed using facial landmark points (Mediapipe library).
  - [Vehicle dynamics](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-2-vehicle-dynamics) : a vehicle dynamics simulator  implemented using the Pacejka tire model, with ABS and Traction Control Systems (TCS) using PID controllers. Tests were executed for maximum velocity and braking on different surfaces.
  - [Vehicle control](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-3-control-functions) : control of an autonomous vehicle  to follow a trajectory. Various control techniques were applied and compared for performance.

- [Implementation of a GAN Applied to an Image Inpainting Task](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Machine-Learning) - group project :  ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)
