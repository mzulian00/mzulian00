![simulink](https://img.shields.io/badge/Framework-Simulink-white)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue)
  - [Image processing](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-1-image-processing) :  implemented a machine learning algorithm to detect driver drowsiness and focus. Eye openness and gaze direction were analyzed using facial landmark points (Mediapipe library).
  - [Vehicle dynamics](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-2-vehicle-dynamics) : a vehicle dynamics simulator  implemented using the Pacejka tire model, with also ABS, and Traction Control Systems (TCS) using PID controllers. Tests were executed for maximum velocity and braking on different surfaces.
  - [Vehicle control](https://github.com/mzulian00/project-Technologies-Autonomous-Vehicles/tree/main/project-3-control-functions) : control of an autonomous vehicle  to follow a trajectory. Various control techniques were applied and compared for performance.
